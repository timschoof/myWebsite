  <h3>Individual differences in hearing aid outcomes</h3>
  <p>My postdoctoral work at Northwestern University focuses on understanding individual differences 
  that predict hearing aid outcomes, including speech in noise perception, listening effort, and perceived sound quality. 
  Previous laboratory-based studies suggest a link between an individual's susceptibility to signal modification 
  caused by hearing aid processing and cognitive function.
  
  We are currently running a clinical trial, using comercially available hearing aids, that investigates the effects of
  signal modification introduced by wide-dynamic range compression speed and frequency compression.
  We hypothesize that hearing aid outcomes will relate to individual differences in audiometric 
  thresholds, working memory capacity, age, and spectro-temporal processing.

  <h3>The effects of ageing on speech perception in noise</h3>
  <p>My PhD research aimed to answer the question why older adults with normal hearing experience increased
  difficulties understanding speech in the presence of background noise. I looked at the relative contributions
  of age-related declines in subcortical auditory processing, as measured by the auditory brainstem 
  response (ABR) and the frequency following response (FFR), and declines in cognitive processing. 
  In short, the data suggested that auditory  neuropathy  and  cognitive declines  associated  with  ageing,
  in the absence of hearing impairment, do  not  necessarily  lead  to  increased  speech  in  noise
  difficulties.
