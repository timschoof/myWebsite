      <description>I am a research scientist at Starkey Hearing Technologies, where I help design, conduct, and analyse experiments that impact future hearing aid technology. Outside of hearing science, my interests include statistics, data visualisation, programming in R, and travelling the world. I can&amp;rsquo;t resist a good learning curve, so my latest learning adventures include Bayesian data analysis, getting to grips with Python, and baking bread. I previously worked in academia as a postdoctoral researcher at University College London and Northwestern University.</description>
