      <description>If you’re involved in hearing science, chances are you’re plotting audiogram data for most of your publications. So why not write some code to make those plots and automate the process? Here I’ll walk you through some R code that you could use and/or adapt to plot your audiogram data.
Getting ready
First things first, let’s make sure you have all the require R packages installed and loaded.</description>

      <description>This work was presented as a poster at the American Auditory Society’s Annual Scientific and Technology Conference, 2-4 March 2017, Scottsdale, AZ. You can download a copy of the poster here.
The National Institutes of Health have recently undertaken steps to enhance rigor and reproducibility of biomedical research. For example, grant applications are now required to explicitly address how the proposed research will achieve robust and unbiased results. Reproducibility is an integral part of science as it allows for research findings to be either validated or refuted and lets scientists successfully build upon previous research.</description>
