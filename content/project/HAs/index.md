My postdoctoral work at Northwestern University focused on understanding individual differences that predict hearing aid outcomes, including speech in noise perception, listening effort, and perceived sound quality. Previous laboratory-based studies suggest a link between an individual's susceptibility to signal modification caused by hearing aid processing and cognitive function. I worked on a clinical trial, using commercially available hearing aids, that investigated the effects of signal modification introduced by wide-dynamic range compression speed and frequency compression. We found that hearing aid outcomes relate to individual differences in audiometric thresholds, age, and working memory capacity.
