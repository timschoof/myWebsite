My PhD research addressed the question why older adults with normal hearing experience increased difficulties understanding speech in the presence of background noise. I looked at the relative contributions of age-related declines in subcortical auditory processing, as measured by the auditory brainstem response (ABR) and the frequency following response (FFR), and declines in cognitive processing. In short, the data suggested that age-related declines in auditory and cognitive processing, in the absence of hearing impairment, do not necessarily lead to increased speech in noise difficulties.
