I am a research scientist at Starkey Hearing Technologies, where I help design, conduct, and analyse experiments that impact future hearing aid technology. 
Outside of hearing science, my interests include statistics, data visualisation, programming in R, and travelling the world. I can't resist a good learning curve, so my latest learning adventures include Bayesian data analysis, getting to grips with some machine learning techniques using tidymodels, and crocheting a cactus. 
I previously worked in academia as a postdoctoral researcher at University College London and Northwestern University. I obtained my PhD in Speech, Hearing, and Phonetic Sciences at University College London in 2014.
